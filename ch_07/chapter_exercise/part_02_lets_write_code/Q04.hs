-- 4. For this next exercise, you’ll experiment with writing pointfree
-- versions of existing code. This involves some new information,
-- so read the following explanation carefully.

-- Typeclasses are dispatched by type. Read is a typeclass like Show,
-- but it is the dual or “opposite” of Show. In general, the Read
-- typeclass isn’t something you should plan to use a lot, but this exercise is structured to teach you something about the interaction
-- between typeclasses and types.

-- The function read in the Read typeclass has the type:
-- read :: Read a => String -> a
-- Notice a pattern?
-- read :: Read a => String -> a
-- show :: Show a => a -> String

-- Write the following code into a source file. Then load it and
-- run it in GHCi to make sure you understand why the evaluation
-- results in the answers you see.
-- arith4.hs
module Arith4 where
-- id :: a -> a
-- id x = x
roundTrip :: (Show a, Read a) => a -> a
roundTrip a = read (show a)
main = do
  print (roundTrip 4)
  print (id 4)
