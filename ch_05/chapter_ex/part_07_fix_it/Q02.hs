-- 2. Now that it’s fixed, make a minor change and make it sing the
-- other song. If you’re lucky, you’ll end up with both songs stuck
-- in your head!

-- Solution:
module Sing where
fstString :: [Char] -> [Char]
fstString x = x ++ " in the rain"

sndString :: [Char] -> [Char]
sndString x = x ++ " over the rainbow"

sing = if (x < y) then fstString x else sndString y
  where 
    x = "Singin"
    y = "Somewhere"
