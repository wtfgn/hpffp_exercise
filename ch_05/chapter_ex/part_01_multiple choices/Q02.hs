-- 2. A function of type [[a]] -> [a] could
-- a) take a list of strings as an argument
-- b) transform a character into a string
-- c) transform a string in to a list of strings
-- d) take two arguments

-- Solution: a) take a list of strings as an argument
-- because if we consider [[a]] to be [[Char]] aka [String],
-- then the function would take a list of strings as an argument.
