-- You will be shown a type and a function that needs to be written. Use
-- the information the type provides to determine what the function
-- should do. Weâ€™ll also tell you how many ways there are to write the
-- function. (Syntactically different but semantically equivalent implementations are not counted as being different).

-- 1. There is only one implementation that typechecks.
-- i :: a -> a
-- i = undefined

-- Solution:
i :: a -> a
i x = x
